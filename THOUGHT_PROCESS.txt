Hour 1
First, I think of what technologies to use. 
It seems over the top to use React to build a simple landing page like this, in part because of SEO. 
But that is probably what you want me to use (instead of simple HTML, CSS, JS) so I will use React. 
I will probably need react router to have links, as well as axios for the get and post requests. 
So I installed those while when setting up npx create-react-app. I then get rid of the unnecessary boilerplate. 
I spend some time fixing up the font and h stylings. 
Using only truetype fonts is not good for cross-platform compatibility so I used an online converter to have woff files of the font as well.
When deploying make sure to use the original woff file for best results.

Hour 2
Set up Router, Switch in App.js.
Make boilerplate files.
Moved to Landing.js and started working there.
Decided to not use styled-components and instead use basic CSS files and linking them to each relevant component.
Set up the hero page.
Made a not-so-fancy not found page too.

Hour 3
Had to figure out that src needs a require function.
Had to figure out that I have to set the Hero test to absolute in order to completely get it to center.
Made the other four parts as IDs.
Realizing the pictures should be shrunken down a bit.

Hour 4
Working on the Apps and the links to it - decided to have the image link to the site only.
Made the subscribe to newsletter things.
Made the footer.
Made the different paths.
Made who we are using CSS grid.

Hour 5
Made the login and sign up pages and fixed up their styling.
Spent most of the time trying to perfect things.

Hour 6
Getting Axios set up for all the post methods
