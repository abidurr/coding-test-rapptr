Hour 1
First, I think of what technologies to use. It seems over the top to use React to build a simple landing page like this, in part because of SEO. But that is probably what you want me to use (instead of simple HTML, CSS, JS) so I will use React. I will probably need react router to have links, as well as axios for the get and post requests. So I installed those while when setting up npx create-react-app. I then get rid of the unnecessary boilerplate. I spend some time fixing up the font and h stylings. Using only truetype fonts is not good for cross-platform compatibility so I used an online converter to have woff files of the font as well.
